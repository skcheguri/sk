## 4. Trust & Safety Features

### 4.1 Tenant Contact Rate Limiting (3-Layer Anti-Bypass System)
- **Goal:** Prevent brokers from mass-contacting owners by limiting how many landlords a tenant can reach.
- **Layer 1 — Client-Side (localStorage):**
  - Authenticated users: per-user timestamps in localStorage, rolling 24h and 7-day windows
  - Non-authenticated users: per-device timestamps in localStorage
  - Limits: 5 daily / 20 weekly for users; 3 daily / 10 weekly for devices
- **Layer 2 — Device Fingerprinting:**
  - Canvas + WebGL + screen + timezone + language + platform fingerprinting
  - Stores timestamps keyed by device fingerprint, surviving incognito mode (same device)
  - Raises the barrier for casual abuse (clearing storage / incognito no longer resets limits)
- **Layer 3 — Server-Side (Supabase Edge Functions + IP Throttling):**
  - Edge Function `check-contact-limit`: checks counts by user_id, device_fingerprint, and IP address
  - Edge Function `record-contact`: inserts a row into `contact_attempts` table with user_id, device_fingerprint, ip_address, listing_id, and timestamp
  - Server limits: 5 daily / 20 weekly per user; 3 daily / 10 weekly per device; 15 daily / 60 weekly per IP
  - Server result takes precedence over client-side when Supabase is connected
- **Enforcement Points:** Listing detail page "Request to Connect" button, Scan landing page "Request to Connect" button, sticky sidebar CTA
- **UI Behavior:** Button becomes disabled gray state showing "Limit Reached" or "Daily Limit Reached"
- **Warning Toast:** Red toast explains whether daily or weekly cap was hit
- **Counter Display:** Shows "X/5 daily · Y/20 weekly" usage in forms and inquiry tabs. Server-enforced limits show a "Server-enforced" badge.
- **Anti-Bypass:**
  - Clearing browser storage → Layer 2 still matches the same device fingerprint
  - Incognito mode → Layer 2 still matches the same device fingerprint
  - Another device → Layer 3 (IP throttling) catches it
  - VPN/proxy → Layer 1 (user account) still limits authenticated users

### 4.2 Broker Reporting System
- **Owner Action:** "Report as Broker" flag icon button on every inquiry card (pending and approved)
- **Report Reasons:** Broker/agent, Asked for commission, Shared competing listings, Refused identity, Other
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Same owner cannot report the same tenant twice
- **Soft Block Trigger:** 2 reports within 48 hours from any owners
- **Soft Block Effects:**
  - Tenant cannot send new contact requests (all "Request to Connect" buttons disabled)
  - Red "Account Restricted" banner on tenant profile
  - "Account Restricted" text on disabled buttons
- **Soft Block Resolution (2 required steps):**
  1. **Re-verify Aadhaar** — one-click simulate verification
  2. **Provide Additional Details** — employer name, company address, reference contact, purpose of renting
- **Storage:** Supabase `broker_reports` table with per-tenant history; `soft_block_states` table tracks resolution progress. When Supabase is not connected, in-memory mock arrays are used as a safe fallback (no localStorage).

### 4.3 Owner Rate Limits

Owners are rate-limited on high-frequency actions to prevent spam and system abuse. These limits are enforced client-side via `localStorage` timestamps (server-side enforcement via Edge Functions when Supabase is connected).

| Action | Daily Limit | Weekly Limit | Storage Key Prefix |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Inquiry responses (approve/decline) | 50 | 200 | `bungalow_owner_inquiry_responses_` |
| Chat messages sent | 100 | 500 | `bungalow_owner_chat_` |
| Community posts created | 5 | 15 | `bungalow_owner_community_` |

**UI Behavior:**
- **Banner Warning:** When owner approaches 80% of any daily limit, a yellow banner appears at the top of the relevant tab: "You are close to your daily message limit (X/100)."
- **Hard Block:** At 100%, the action button is disabled with tooltip: "Daily limit reached — try again tomorrow."
- **Progress Bar:** Inline progress indicator on owner profile tabs showing daily usage percentage.
- **Toast Feedback:** Success toast on every action; error toast when limit is hit with the reason.

**Reset Schedule:** Daily limits reset at midnight IST. Weekly limits reset every Sunday at midnight IST.

### 4.4 Push Notifications

#### 4.4.1 Delivery Stack
- **Primary:** Browser push via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Fallback 1:** SMS for critical events (payment failure, account restriction, lease expiry)
- **Fallback 2:** Email for non-urgent events (new inquiry, maintenance update, community reply)
- **Final Fallback:** In-app notification center (always available)

#### 4.4.2 Notification Types & Channels
| Type | Push | SMS | Email | In-App |
|------|------|-----|-------|--------|
| New inquiry | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Inquiry approved/declined | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Rent payment due (3 days) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Rent payment failed | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| Community reply | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

#### 4.4.3 Delivery Status Tracking
Every notification stores a delivery record:
- `sent_at` — when the notification was generated
- `push_delivered` — boolean, confirmed via FCM receipt
- `sms_delivered` — boolean, confirmed via SMS provider webhook
- `email_delivered` — boolean, confirmed via email provider webhook
- `read_at` — timestamp when user opened the in-app notification

#### 4.4.4 Channel Preferences
Users can toggle each channel per notification type in Settings:
- Push: on/off globally (requires browser permission grant)
- SMS: on/off for critical events only
- Email: on/off per category (maintenance, inquiries, payments, lease, community, platform)

#### 4.4.5 FCM Registration Flow
1. User clicks "Enable Push Notifications" in Settings
2. Browser requests Notification permission
3. If granted, service worker registers and receives FCM token
4. Token stored in `user_push_tokens` table (one row per device)
5. On logout, token is deactivated; on re-login, token is re-activated

#### 4.4.6 Data Model Additions
**Table: user_push_tokens**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| user_id | uuid | FK → users |
| fcm_token | text | Firebase token |
| device_name | text | Browser / OS label |
| active | boolean | Whether token is valid |
| created_at | timestamp | Token creation |
| updated_at | timestamp | Last update |

---

### 4.5 Offline Mode Behavior

When the user's device loses internet connectivity or Supabase is not configured, the app operates in **Offline Mode** using local mock data and cached state.

#### 4.5.1 What Works Offline
- **Browse listings:** All listing data is served from `src/mocks/listings.ts`
- **View listing detail:** Property info, landlord card, gallery, amenities
- **Community forum:** Read posts and comments from mock data
- **Owner dashboard:** View properties, listings, tenants, inquiries (read-only)
- **Tenant dashboard:** View saved listings, inquiries, documents (read-only)
- **Tax calculators:** All form inputs and calculations (pure client-side)
- **Rent receipt / agreement generators:** Generate and preview PDFs locally
- **Notification history:** Read cached notifications
- **Aadhaar verification UI:** Upload flow (verification step queued for retry)

#### 4.5.2 What Is Disabled Offline
- **Contact / Request to Connect:** "Request to Connect" buttons are disabled with tooltip: "Connect to the internet to contact landlords."
- **Send chat message:** Message input disabled with placeholder: "Messages will send when you're back online."
- **Create new post / comment:** "Publish" button disabled with offline warning
- **Submit maintenance request:** Form submission blocked; "Save as Draft" option offered
- **Rent payment:** All payment tabs disabled; offline payment logging allowed with "Queue for sync" label
- **Broker report:** Report button disabled
- **Aadhaar verification submit:** Submit button disabled; images cached locally for later upload

#### 4.5.3 Graceful Degradation
- **Online indicator:** Small dot in navbar — green when online, gray when offline
- **Toast on disconnect:** "You are offline. Some features are unavailable." (auto-dismisses on reconnect)
- **Queued actions:** Actions attempted while offline are queued in `localStorage` and auto-retry on reconnect
- **Sync banner:** When reconnecting, a banner shows: "Back online — syncing X pending changes..."
- **Form drafts:** All multi-step forms auto-save to `localStorage` every 10 seconds; restored on return

  - Admin pages accessible only to users with `role = admin`
- **Protected Routes:** Unauthenticated users redirected to login. Wrong-role users redirected to their appropriate dashboard.

### 6.2 Property Listings
- **CRUD Operations:** Landlords can create, read, update, delete listings
- **Image Upload:** Multiple images per listing, max 10 images
- **Status Management:** Active (visible to public), Inactive (hidden), Draft (incomplete)
- **Verification Badge:** Listings marked verified after landlord ownership is confirmed
- **Analytics Tracking:** Views, inquiries, saves per listing
- **QR Code Generation:** Unique QR code per active listing linking to `/scan/:id`

### 6.3 Search & Filter
- **Location Search:** Text-based search across city, locality, address
- **Filters:** Price min/max, bedrooms, bathrooms, property type, furnished status
- **Sort By:** Price ascending/descending, newest first, most viewed
- **Pagination:** 12 listings per page

### 6.4 Maintenance Request System
- **Tenant Flow:** Submit request → select category → describe issue → upload photos → track status
- **Landlord Flow:** View all requests → filter by status/priority → update status → add notes
- **Priority Levels:** Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **Status Lifecycle:** Pending → In Progress → Completed (or Rejected)
- **Notifications:** Both parties receive status change notifications

### 6.5 Aadhaar Verification

#### 6.5.1 Purpose
Identity verification for trust and safety. Verified badge shown on profile once approved.

#### 6.5.2 Flow
1. User uploads Aadhaar front + back images (JPG/PNG, max 5MB each)
2. **OCR Extraction** — system extracts name, Aadhaar number, DOB, gender, address, and photo from both sides using OCR
3. **Name Matching** — extracted name is compared against the user's profile name (fuzzy match, 80% threshold)
4. **Provider Verification** — extracted data is sent to third-party KYC provider for real-time validation against UIDAI records
5. If all checks pass → status becomes **Verified**
6. If any check fails → status becomes **Rejected** with specific failure reason

#### 6.5.3 Verification Provider
Recommended provider: **IDfy** or **Signzy** (India-authorized KYC APIs with direct UIDAI connectivity). Fallback: **Karza** or **Digilocker** integration if primary provider is unavailable.

#### 6.5.4 Masking Rules
- **Storage:** Full Aadhaar number is NEVER stored in plain text. Store only:
  - Last 4 digits (e.g., `**** **** 1234`)
  - A masked hash for duplicate detection
  - OCR-extracted metadata (name, DOB, gender, address) without the number
- **Display:** Show only last 4 digits everywhere in the UI. Tooltip says "Aadhaar verified for trust & safety. Full number never stored."
- **API:** Edge Functions handle provider calls; API keys stored in Supabase secrets only

#### 6.5.5 Retry Logic
- **Max Attempts:** 3 upload attempts per 24-hour window
- **Retry Flow:**
  - 1st failure → show specific error + allow immediate re-upload
  - 2nd failure → same, with stronger guidance (e.g., "Ensure all 4 corners of the card are visible")
  - 3rd failure → lock Aadhaar upload for 24 hours; show "Too many attempts — try again tomorrow"
- **Re-verification:** If user updates their profile name, Aadhaar must be re-verified (name mismatch guard)

#### 6.5.6 Failure Reasons (System → User)
| Failure Code | User-Facing Message |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `BLURRY_IMAGE` | "Image is blurry or unreadable. Please upload a clearer photo with good lighting." |
| `NAME_MISMATCH` | "Name on Aadhaar does not match your profile name. Update your profile name or contact support." |
| `INVALID_AADHAAR` | "Invalid Aadhaar number detected. Please upload a valid Aadhaar card." |
| `ALREADY_USED` | "This Aadhaar is already linked to another account. Each user can verify only once." |
| `PROVIDER_ERROR` | "Verification service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes." |
| `EXPIRED_SESSION` | "Verification session expired. Please restart the upload process." |

#### 6.5.7 Aadhaar Verification Failure States
1. **Blurry image** — OCR cannot read text; extraction confidence score below 70%
2. **Mismatch with profile name** — fuzzy name match falls below 80% threshold
3. **Invalid Aadhaar** — number fails UIDAI checksum validation or provider returns invalid
4. **Already used by another account** — masked hash matches an existing verified Aadhaar in the database

#### 6.5.8 Privacy & Status States
- **Status States:** Not Submitted → Pending Verification → Verified → Rejected
- **Data Retention:** If rejected, uploaded images are auto-deleted after 30 days. If verified, images are deleted immediately after extraction; only metadata is retained.
- **Consent:** User must check a consent box before upload: "I consent to Bhavan verifying my Aadhaar for trust & safety purposes. My Aadhaar number will be masked and never shared publicly."

### 6.6 Connection Requests (Inquiries)
- **Tenant Action:** Send inquiry to landlord for a specific listing with a message
- **Landlord Action:** Approve or decline with optional response message
- **Status:** Pending → Approved / Declined
- **Approved Connection:** Enables chat between tenant and landlord
- **Notifications:** Landlord notified on new inquiry; tenant notified on response
- **Rate Limiting:** 3-layer anti-bypass system (user / device fingerprint / IP) enforcing 5 daily / 20 weekly per user, 3 daily / 10 weekly per device, 15 daily / 60 weekly per IP. See Section 4.1 for full specification.

### 6.7 Chat / Messaging
- **Trigger:** Available only after landlord approves tenant's connection request
- **Features:** Real-time messaging UI, message read receipts, conversation list per connection
- **Context:** Each chat tied to a specific connection request for clarity
- **Owner UI:** Split-pane layout (conversation list left, chat thread right)
- **Navigation:** "Open Chat" button on approved inquiries jumps to Messages tab with pre-selected conversation

### 6.8 Broker Reporting
- **Owner Action:** Report tenant inquiry as broker/agent with reason selection
- **Soft Block:** 2 reports within 48 hours triggers soft block on tenant
- **Block Effects:** Tenant cannot send new connection requests; account shows restricted banner
- **Resolution:** Re-verify Aadhaar + provide additional employment/renting details
- **Storage:** Supabase `broker_reports` table; `soft_block_states` table for soft-block resolution. Hook auto-detects Supabase connection and falls back to in-memory mock arrays when offline.

## 13. Rent Payment Integration

### 13.1 Overview
The platform provides a complete rent payment flow for tenants to pay their landlords digitally, and for landlords to track, reconcile, and manage rent collections. The system supports India's most popular payment methods — UPI, bank transfers, and offline payment logging — with automated failure handling and landlord-side reconciliation.

### 13.2 Tenant Payment Flow

#### 13.2.1 Pay Rent Page (`/rent-payment`)
- **Header Card:** Shows current month's rent due, property name, flat number, due date, and days remaining. Includes a large "Pay Now" CTA.
- **Payment Methods (tabbed):**
  - **UPI AutoPay Tab:** Shows active mandate status (if any), upcoming auto-debit date, mandate amount. Option to set up new mandate with UPI ID / bank selection.
  - **UPI QR Tab:** Generates a unique UPI QR code with pre-filled amount, tenant name, and landlord VPA. Tenant scans with any UPI app.
  - **Bank Transfer Tab:** Displays landlord's masked bank details (account number, IFSC, bank name) for NEFT/RTGS/IMPS.
  - **Offline Tab:** Log cash or cheque payments manually with receipt number and date fields.
- **Payment History:** Full table of past rent payments with status, amount, mode, transaction ref, receipt download.
- **Failure Banner:** When a payment fails, a prominent banner shows the failure reason with retry and alternate method CTAs.

#### 13.2.2 UPI AutoPay
- **Mandate Setup:** Tenant enters UPI ID, selects bank, confirms mandate amount (monthly rent), and authorizes via Razorpay eNACH UPI flow.
- **Mandate Status:** Active mandates show next debit date. Paused/cancelled mandates show history.
- **Failure Handling:** If auto-debit fails (insufficient funds, UPI limit exceeded), tenant gets a push notification + in-app banner with "Retry" and "Pay Manually" options.
- **Reconciliation:** Auto-debit payments are auto-marked as `paid` when Razorpay webhook confirms success.

#### 13.2.3 UPI QR Code
- **Dynamic QR:** Each payment generates a unique QR with a Razorpay payment link embedded. QR includes: landlord VPA, amount, tenant reference.
- **Scan-to-Pay:** Tenant scans with PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, or any UPI app. Payment reflects in Bhavan within minutes via webhook.
- **Expiry:** QR codes expire after 24 hours for security. A fresh QR can be regenerated anytime.

#### 13.2.4 Payment Failure Handling
- **Failure Reasons Tracked:** UPI_TIMEOUT, BANK_REJECTED, INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, USER_CANCELLED, RISK_REJECTED.
- **UI Behavior:**
  - Banner at top of `/rent-payment` explaining the failure and suggested action
  - "Retry Payment" button triggers the same method again
  - "Try Another Method" button switches to a different payment tab
  - "Contact Landlord" opens chat or shows landlord phone
- **Notification:** Push notification + email sent to tenant on payment failure.
- **Grace for Late Rent:** If payment fails within 3 days of due date, tenant sees a "Late Payment Warning" with potential penalty info.

### 13.3 Landlord Payment Management

#### 13.3.1 Rent Collection Dashboard
- **Overview Cards:** Total collected this month, outstanding amount, on-time payment rate, overdue count.
- **Tenant Payment Table:** Per-tenant view showing: tenant name, flat, rent amount, due date, payment status (Paid / Pending / Failed / Overdue), last payment date, action buttons (Send Reminder, View History).
- **Overdue Actions:** Bulk "Send Reminder" to all overdue tenants. Individual reminder with pre-filled message.

#### 13.3.2 Payment Reconciliation
- **Bank Statement Matching:** Landlord uploads or pastes bank statement entries. System auto-matches by amount + date to `rent_payments` records.
- **Manual Reconciliation:** For unmatched entries, landlord selects the matching tenant and month, adds a note, and marks as reconciled.
- **Reconciliation Status:** Each payment shows `reconciled` / `pending_reconciliation` / `unmatched` badge.
- **Reconciliation Panel:** Owner profile → Tenants tab → "Reconcile Payments" sub-panel.

#### 13.3.3 Razorpay Recurring for Landlords
- **Pro Feature:** Pro landlords can enable Razorpay recurring payment links for their tenants.
- **Setup:** Landlord generates a subscription link per tenant with fixed monthly amount. Tenant subscribes once, pays automatically every month.
- **Tracking:** Landlord sees all recurring subscriptions in a table with status, next charge date, and total collected.
