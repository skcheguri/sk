## 4. Owner Subscription Model (Free vs Pro)

### 4.1 Overview
Bhavan runs a **Freemium subscription model exclusively for Property Owners / Landlords**. Tenants never pay. Owners start on a generous Free tier and upgrade to Pro for advanced tools.

- Unlimited tenant inquiries per month
- Basic landlord dashboard with simple metrics
- Standard property listing with photos and description
- QR code generation for listings
- Basic maintenance request tracking
- Standard chat with approved tenants
- Community access
- Email notifications for new inquiries

**Limitations:**
- No advanced analytics (revenue trends, conversion rates, tenant retention)
- No automated rent reminders or recurring rent collection
- No priority support
- No bulk rent receipt generation
- No advanced tax form auto-filling
- No custom branded listing URLs
- Listings show "Free" badge to tenants

### 4.3 Pro Tier
**Cost:** ₹199/month or ₹999/year (~58% savings with annual)

**Everything in Free, plus:**
- Advanced Analytics Dashboard (revenue trends, conversion funnel, listing rankings, maintenance resolution metrics)
- Automated Rent Management (auto-reminders, lease expiry alerts, bulk receipt generation)

- Export data to CSV/Excel

### 4.4 Razorpay Subscription Integration
- **Gateway:** Razorpay (UPI, cards, net banking, wallets)
- **Token Field:** `razorpay_subscription_id` stored in `owner_subscriptions` table
- **Flow:** Owner selects plan → Razorpay checkout modal → payment → webhook updates status to `active` → immediate Pro access

**Subscription Status States:**
- `trial` — 7-day free trial for new landlords
- `active` — Paid Pro subscription is current
- `past_due` — Payment failed, 7-day grace period
- `cancelled` — Owner cancelled, reverts to Free at period end
- `expired` — Grace period lapsed, reverts to Free immediately

### 4.5 Billing History
- Stored in `billing_history` table, linked to `owner_subscriptions`
- Invoice number format: `BGL-YYYY-0001`
- Amount stored in paise (₹19900 for ₹199)
- GST at 18% (IGST) tracked separately
- Status: `paid`, `failed`, `refunded`, `pending`
- Downloadable PDF per invoice
- Billing tab in owner profile shows full history with filters

### 4.6 Auto-Renewal Logic
- **Default:** All Pro subscriptions auto-renew by default
- **Notification:** Email sent 3 days before renewal
- **Failure Handling:**
  - 1st failure → retry after 24 hours
  - 2nd failure → email with "Update Payment Method" link
  - 3rd failure → status becomes `past_due`
  - After 7 days in `past_due` → status becomes `expired`, reverts to Free
- **Owner Control:** Toggle auto-renewal on/off in Billing tab settings

### 4.7 Grace Period
- **Duration:** 7 days after failed renewal payment
- **Behavior:** Owner retains full Pro access during grace period
- **UI:** Banner at top of dashboard — "Payment failed — update your payment method within 7 days to keep Pro access"
- **After Grace Period:**
  - Status becomes `expired`, reverts to Free immediately
  - All properties and listings remain fully accessible
  - No content is hidden or deactivated upon downgrade
